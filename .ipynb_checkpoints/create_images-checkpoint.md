### Questions Regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

#### **1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.**

**Answer:**

The breed of the dog in `Dog_01.jpg` (Basenji_00963.jpg) was classified as follows:

- **ResNet:** basenji
- **AlexNet:** basenji
- **VGG:** basenji

All three models classified the breed of the dog in `Dog_01.jpg` as "basenji." There are no differences in the breed classification across the three models.

#### **2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.**

**Answer:**

For the provided images:

- **ResNet:**
  - `Dog_01.jpg` (Basenji_00963.jpg): basenji
  - `Dog_02.jpg` (Beagle_01125.jpg): beagle

- **AlexNet:**
  - `Dog_01.jpg` (Basenji_00963.jpg): basenji
  - `Dog_02.jpg` (Beagle_01125.jpg): English foxhound

- **VGG:**
  - `Dog_01.jpg` (Basenji_00963.jpg): basenji
  - `Dog_02.jpg` (Beagle_01125.jpg): beagle

**Differences:**
- **ResNet and VGG** classify `Dog_01.jpg` as "basenji" and `Dog_02.jpg` as "beagle," showing consistency.
- **AlexNet** classifies `Dog_01.jpg` as "basenji," but `Dog_02.jpg` as "English foxhound," which differs from ResNet and VGG’s classification.

#### **3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.**

For the non-dog images:

- **ResNet:**
  - `fox_squirrel_01.jpg`: fox squirrel
  - `gecko_02.jpg`: African chameleon

- **AlexNet:**
  - `fox_squirrel_01.jpg`: fox squirrel
  - `gecko_02.jpg`: alligator lizard

- **VGG:**
  - `fox_squirrel_01.jpg`: fox squirrel
  - `gecko_02.jpg`: banded gecko

**Misclassifications:**
- **ResNet** and **VGG** correctly identify `fox_squirrel_01.jpg` and `gecko_02.jpg` as non-dogs.
- **AlexNet** misclassifies `gecko_02.jpg` as "alligator lizard," whereas ResNet and VGG correctly identify it as a non-dog.

#### **4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.**

**Answer:**

Based on the analysis:

- **VGG** performed consistently well across all test cases. It correctly identified the breed of `Dog_01.jpg` and `Dog_02.jpg` without discrepancies and accurately classified non-dog images (`fox_squirrel_01.jpg` and `gecko_02.jpg`).

- **ResNet** also showed strong performance, with consistent results for `Dog_01.jpg` and `Dog_02.jpg` and correct classification of non-dog images.

- **AlexNet** displayed some inconsistencies, particularly in breed classification of `Dog_02.jpg` and a misclassification of `gecko_02.jpg`.

**Selected Model:** **VGG** is selected as the best model for classifying the four uploaded images due to its accuracy and consistency in all tested cases.

### Explanation of Files, Approach, and Steps:

#### Files Involved:

1. **`classify_pet_images.py`**:
   - **Purpose**: This script orchestrates the classification of images using different model architectures. It imports a `classifier` function from the `classifier` module and applies it to a set of images with various models.
   - **Key Components**:
     - **Imports**: Uses the `os` module for file path handling and the `classifier` function for the classification task.
     - **`classify_images` Function**:
       - **Purpose**: Manages the classification of multiple images with various models and organizes the results.
       - **Parameters**:
         - `image_paths`: A list of image file paths to be classified.
         - `model_names`: A list of model architectures to be used (e.g., ResNet, AlexNet, VGG).
       - **Process**:
         - Iterates over each model and image, calling the `classifier` function to get predictions.
         - Stores the results in a dictionary, with the model name as the key and another dictionary (mapping image names to labels) as the value.
       - **Relevance**: Provides a structured and systematic way to classify images across different models and collect results for comparison.

2. **`classifier.py`**:
   - **Purpose**: Contains the `classifier` function responsible for the actual classification of images. It interacts with different model architectures to predict labels for the input images.
   - **Relevance**: This module encapsulates the logic for how images are classified using the specified models, making it a critical component of the image classification process.

#### Approach and Steps:

1. **Setup and Imports**:
   - **Execution**: 
     - Import necessary modules (`os` for file handling, `classifier` for performing the classification).
   - **Relevance**: Ensures that the script can handle file operations and utilize the classification logic needed for processing the images.
